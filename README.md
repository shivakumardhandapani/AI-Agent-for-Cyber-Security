# AI-Agent-for-Cyber-Security
This repo is for the FAI project.

  This project uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents in a network defense environment (gym-idsgame). The goal is to compare how different RL algorithms, such as Qlearning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double DQN (DDQN), SARSA and other such algorithms,  perform against random actions. The environment simulates an attacker trying to breach the system and a defender attempting to block attacks.

About the environment: 
  gym-idsgame is a reinforcement learning environment designed for simulating attack and defense operations in an abstract network intrusion game. Offers multiple registered environments for different scenarios, such as minimal defense, maximal attack, random attack, and two-agent simulations.Supports training with algorithms like Tabular Q-learning, Neural-fitted Q-learning (DQN), REINFORCE, Actor-Critic REINFORCE, and PPO
